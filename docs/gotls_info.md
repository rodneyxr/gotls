## gotls info

Show information about a certificate or key PEM file (or all certs in a directory)

### Synopsis

The info command inspects certificates and private keys and prints useful details.

When given a certificate file (.crt/.pem) the command prints subject CN, SANs (DNS names, IPs, emails),
serial number, validity (Not Before / Not After), whether it's a CA, key usages, issuer,
OCSP/CRL endpoints, and public key algorithm/size.

When given a directory, the command scans for .crt and .pem files and prints the same info
for each certificate it finds.

```
gotls info <file|dir> [flags]
```

### Examples

```
  # Show info for a single cert
  gotls info ./certs/example.com.crt

  # Show info for all certs in a directory
  gotls info ./certs/

  # Create fullchain for each cert (auto-detects CA in same directory)
  gotls info ./certs/ --fullchain

  # Create fullchain with specific CA cert
  gotls info ./certs/ --fullchain --ca-cert ./certs/ca.crt

  # Same as above but print base64-encoded fullchain to stdout
  gotls info ./certs/ --fullchain --base64
```

### Options

```
      --base64           When used with --fullchain, base64 encode the fullchain and print to stdout
      --ca-cert string   Path to CA certificate to append when --fullchain is used
      --fullchain        Append CA certificate to each cert to create a fullchain
  -h, --help             help for info
```
